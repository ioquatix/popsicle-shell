# Popsicle Shell

This repository includes a fully parametric reversiable ice cream mold and stick. It is designed to be used with play dough.

## Motivation

My daughter loves playdoh and wanted to make ice creams. So, I designed this model with her.

## Parts Required

Noting in particular.

## Instructions

1. Print out two shells and a stick. I actually recommend **several sticks** if you are intending to use this with children.
2. Fill with (ideally rainbow coloured) play dough and place stick in the middle.

3. Press together until shell is completely closed, and scrape away any excess coming out the sides.
